# Data-analysis-practice_College
research experiment with the purpose of better understanding how people analyze data
Your assignment is to study how income varies across different categories of college majors. You will be using data from a study of recent college graduates. Make sure to use good practices that you have learned so far in this course and previous courses in the specialization.In particular, it is good practice to specify an analysis plan early in the process to avoid the “p-hacking” behavior of trying many analyses to find one that has desired results.
